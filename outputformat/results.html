I’m here to assist you. There could be a few reasons why the withdrawal of $1,000 isn&#39;t reflected in your account. Let me help you with this:

1. **Transaction Processing Time**: Sometimes, transactions can take a little time to process, especially if it was done electronically or outside of business hours.

2. **ATM or System Error**: If you withdrew the money from an ATM or online, there might have been an error. Check to see if you received a receipt or confirmation of the transaction.

3. **Account Balance Refresh**: Refresh your account balance or log out and back into your online banking to see if the changes take effect.

4. **Pending Transactions**: Check your account for any pending transactions that might be affecting your available balance.

5. **Contact Customer Service**: If the amount still isn’t reflecting in your account, you may need to contact customer service or visit a branch for further assistance. 

Please let me know what you&#39;ve checked so far, and I can guide you further!

I understand your concern about the $1000 withdrawal not showing in your account. Let me help you resolve this issue.

To assist you better, I need a few details:

1. **When did you make the withdrawal?** (Date and approximate time)
2. **How did you withdraw?** (ATM, bank teller, or online transfer?)
3. **Did you receive a receipt or transaction confirmation?**
4. **Which account did you withdraw from?** (Checking or Savings?)

In the meantime, here are some common reasons for delays:

- **Processing time**: Transactions can take 24-48 hours to reflect, especially if made after business hours or on weekends
- **ATM issues**: If using an ATM, there might have been a technical issue
- **Pending status**: The transaction might be pending and will update soon

**Immediate steps I can take:**
- Check your recent transaction history
- Verify if the withdrawal was processed successfully
- File a transaction dispute if needed
- Provide you with a temporary credit if the funds were dispensed but not debited

Could you please provide those details so I can investigate this further for you?

I understand your frustration, and I&#39;m here to help resolve this issue for you.

Let me look into this right away. To assist you better, I&#39;ll need a few details:

1. **Which account** was charged the overdraft fee?
2. **What date** did this fee appear?
3. **What was your account balance** at the time of the transaction that triggered the fee?

In the meantime, here are some common reasons this might happen:

- **Pending transactions** that hadn&#39;t cleared yet, reducing your available balance
- **Holds placed on deposits** (checks may take time to fully clear)
- **Timing of transactions** - sometimes debits process before credits on the same day
- **Available vs. current balance** confusion

Once you provide those details, I can:
- Review your account history
- Identify what caused the fee
- Request a refund if the fee was charged in error
- Explain any holds or pending items

Would you be able to share those details so I can investigate this for you?
